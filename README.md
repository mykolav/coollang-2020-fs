# The Cool 2016 language compiler implemented in F#

## This is a work in progress and at a very early stage.

[CoolAid: The Cool 2016 Reference Manual](http://pabst.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs654/handouts/cool-manual.pdf)

> This manual describes the programming language Cool: the Classroom Object-Oriented Language. Cool
is a small language that can be implemented in a one semester course. Still, Cool retains many of
the features of modern programming languages including objects, static typing, and automatic memory
management...  

> Cool 2016 is a subset of Scala; ...  

> Cool programs are sets of classes. A class encapsulates the variables and procedures of a data type.
Instances of a class are objects. In Cool, classes and types are identified; i.e., every class defines a type.
Classes permit programmers to define new types and associated procedures (or methods) specific to those
types. Inheritance allows new types to extend the behavior of existing types.  

> Cool is an expression language. Most Cool constructs are expressions, and every expression has a
value and a type. Cool is type safe: procedures are guaranteed to be applied to data of the correct type.
While static typing imposes a strong discipline on programming in Cool, it guarantees that no runtime
type errors can arise in the execution of Cool programs.
